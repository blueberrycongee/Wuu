## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Added Kimi K3 Anthropic compatibility, including K3-specific thinking and empty-signature handling.
- Added context-overflow detection, recovery, and user-visible display for BYOK providers.

- Added support for diversified subagent name pools.
- Added the ability to switch projects while background runs are still active.
- Added a bilingual user guide covering core desktop and agent workflows.

### Changed

- Unified terminal session history into a single shared history model.
- Dropped derived context ledgers from the default model projection.
- Simplified the sidebar wordmark color treatment.
- Scoped environment Git configuration to the active session workspace.
- Memoized conversation turns on server-event re-renders to improve idle performance.
- Reduced idle renderer activity across the desktop conversation view.
- Kept process summaries neutral and hidden from the main conversation stream.
- Unified composer actions into a single plus menu.

### Fixed

- Interrupted turns now show answer actions and prevent stacked query overlap.
- Turn edit summary cards now appear before answer action buttons.
- Background completion wakeups are now waited on correctly before proceeding.
- Model-aware summary output limits are recovered after compaction.
- Messages can be edited after history compaction.
- Conversation layout is settled before reveal, preventing flicker on tab switch.
- Stream follow pauses during text selection.
- Stable single-line retry error display is shown while a turn retries or recovers.
- First query is shown before thread creation completes.
- Zero-usage model buckets are hidden from the settings usage panel.
- Synchronous shell process trees are stopped correctly.
- Terminal quota replays are stopped during recovery.
- OpenAI Responses WebSocket cache TTL is extended.
- Usage number overflow is prevented in heatmap and inline displays.
- Usage heatmap intensity is restored after theme changes.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Embedded browser activities can now be automated through a dedicated backend
  and shown in a live macOS picture-in-picture preview.
- The desktop interface now supports English and Simplified Chinese.
- Interrupted turns preserve queued follow-up messages for the next turn.
- Git commits can optionally include WUU Agent attribution.

### Changed

- Runtime model selection is now conversation-scoped, and side chats and
  automatic titles inherit the conversation's pinned model.
- Desktop settings use a grouped-list layout, hover drawers animate in and out,
  and the macOS sidebar preserves the wallpaper tint.
- The composer stop control now uses a smaller solid glyph on a neutral surface.
- The retired `inception` context-rewrite tool has been removed while legacy
  session artifacts remain readable.

### Fixed

- OpenAI Responses WebSocket failures now use reason-specific SSE fallback
  windows, allowing transient failures to recover without a ten-minute pin.
- Truncated tool arguments and empty Anthropic thinking blocks no longer break
  provider history recovery.
- Composer focus handoffs, held-message deduplication, and jump-to-latest state
  remain stable across sends, interrupts, and conversation switches.
- Embedded browser PiP startup and window reparenting no longer race.
- Production desktop builds disable reload and developer-tools shortcuts.
- Git action locks are scoped to the active worktree.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Inline code in message conversations and workspace Markdown previews now
  uses a dark theme-aware surface instead of retaining the light chip background.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- The message-flow font-size preview now uses the real conversation renderer,
  so it matches message typography, spacing, and Markdown output.

### Fixed

- Theme changes now stay synchronized across all desktop windows and embedded
  terminals, editors, and Mermaid diagrams.
- Bare URLs followed by CJK punctuation no longer absorb the punctuation into
  the link target.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Scheduled automations now run through persisted threads and turns, support
  new-thread and heartbeat modes, and retain bounded run history.
- The core and desktop source now include Windows-aware process, shell-path,
  window-chrome, and packaging support. GitHub Releases remain macOS-only.

### Changed

- The desktop conversation and composer stay centered at readable widths on
  wide windows, while environment and group panels scale responsively.
- Internal process notifications are hidden from conversations, and command
  and search activity summaries more accurately describe completed work.

### Fixed

- Failed and interrupted turns preserve completed assistant and tool history
  across reloads, including partial response text already shown before a stop.
- Scheduled runs avoid overlapping or unbounded queued work, expired paused
  schedules are removed, and corrupt run-history files no longer block startup.
- Desktop side-panel headers retain their intended layout and typography.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- GitHub Releases now contain only the unsigned macOS arm64 desktop DMG and ZIP
  packages; standalone CLI archives and the npm installer are no longer
  published.

### Fixed

- The desktop app now always runs its bundled private `wuu-core` and no longer
  installs, replaces, or falls back to a standalone `wuu` CLI. A CLI installed
  separately from source can coexist with the app and use a different version.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Large built-in tool results are settled once at execution time into bounded,
  artifact-backed projections with an explicit recovery path to the complete
  result.
- Structured and rich tool results now keep bounded semantic indexes through
  provider requests and checkpoint compaction, including stable content
  identity and representative values.
- Compacted media references preserve the media type, decoded size, SHA-256
  identity, and image dimensions when available.

### Changed

- Request-time historical tool-output pruning has been removed. Context growth
  is now handled by stable result projection followed by checkpoint compaction,
  so ordinary tool-loop requests keep an append-only cacheable prefix.
- Archived desktop sessions are grouped by project, and conversation search,
  model menus, memory controls, and narrow usage tables use a quieter layout.
- Release versions are synchronized from `VERSION`, validated in CI, and
  published with the matching changelog section.
- The npm wrapper installs the GitHub Release matching its own package version
  instead of silently resolving the latest release.
- Public evaluation claims now have a dedicated, CI-validated evidence format
  under `evals/`; private and exploratory runs remain under ignored `bench/`.

### Fixed

- Rich tool results survive session persistence instead of losing structured
  content or attachment metadata after a restart.
- Compaction and provider projection preserve meaningful mixed structured
  results without duplicating complete payloads into active model context.
- Queued desktop turns no longer hide the preceding final reply, and sidebar
  session loading no longer drops visible history after compaction.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-10
