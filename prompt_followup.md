# Wuu autoloop follow-up

Continue from the previous Codex session and keep working toward the next milestone.

Constraints:
- Stay on `main`.
- Make real code changes (tests first), run WSL validation, then commit+push.
- If you only produced a plan last time, start executing it now.

Target:
- Read `docs/NEXT.md` and complete that milestone (then move to the next one if time allows).
