/**
 * Decide how the desktop launches its private Wuu core.
 *
 * This deliberately NEVER inspects the active workspace for a `bin/wuu` or
 * `wuu` file. A project's local build artifact — which may be stale, built for
 * another OS, or simply not executable — must not be run as the desktop's core
 * (see issue #8: selecting the wuu repo, whose `make build` writes an ignored
 * `bin/wuu`, failed with `spawn ENOEXEC` on macOS because the artifact was a
 * Linux ELF). The active workspace is for user operations; the core binary is
 * desktop-owned or explicitly configured. It never falls back to a `wuu`
 * command on PATH, because that is an independent CLI installation whose
 * version may intentionally differ from the desktop app.
 *
 * Priority:
 *  1. `WUU_DESKTOP_CORE` — an explicit development/test override.
 *  2. `go run ./cmd/wuu` — only when `WUU_DESKTOP_USE_GO_RUN=1` and a source
 *     root was found (local development against the repo).
 *  3. packaged `Resources/bin/wuu-core` — the app-owned core for releases.
