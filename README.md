If you have used OpenCode, Claude Code, or Codex, wuu will feel familiar. The shortest description is: **a desktop GUI for the local coding-agent workflow**.

You still open a project and work with an agent. wuu puts the rest of that workflow into one visible workspace: projects and conversations on the left; the current task in the center; files, diffs, terminals, browser, skills, and model settings alongside it.

wuu is independently developed and is not an official client for OpenCode, Claude Code, or Codex.

> [!WARNING]
> wuu is an early preview and changes quickly. Packaged builds currently support Apple silicon Macs.

## Download

Download the latest build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/blueberrycongee/wuu/releases/latest), move `wuu.app` to `/Applications`, and open it.

The current preview is unsigned and not notarized. If macOS blocks an official release that you trust, run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/wuu.app && open /Applications/wuu.app
```

## What the desktop app adds

- **Projects and conversations** — switch between repositories, search conversations across workspaces, and resume or fork previous work.
- **Files, changes, and terminals** — inspect the repository, review the current Git diff, preview images and documents, and revisit command output without leaving the app.
- **A visual agent timeline** — follow tool calls, background processes, delegated work, and attachments as the task runs.
- **No configuration-file busywork** — manage model providers, permissions, skills, and memory from the desktop app, and inspect the project instructions it loaded.
- **A complete agent experience out of the box** — plans, durable goals, subagents, background tasks, and persistent sessions are built in rather than left for you to assemble.

## Get started

1. Open **Settings → Model providers** and connect Anthropic or an OpenAI-compatible provider.
2. Add a local project folder.
3. Start a conversation.

See the [user guide](https://blueberrycongee.github.io/wuu/en/getting-started/) for provider setup, permissions, attachments, and sessions.

## CLI

The desktop app includes its own core and does not require a separate CLI. For scripts, CI, or non-interactive work, install `wuu` with Go. The module currently declares Go 1.26.5:

```bash
go install github.com/blueberrycongee/wuu/cmd/wuu@latest
wuu --version
wuu init

wuu exec "fix the failing tests and verify the result"
wuu exec --json "review the current diff"
wuu exec review --uncommitted
```

See the [`wuu exec` guide](docs/en/automation/exec.md) for structured output, attachments, session controls, and review options.

## Models and local data

- You choose the provider and credentials. Prompts and relevant context are sent to that provider.
- Sessions, config, logs, and other local state live under `~/.wuu` by default.
- File changes and commands run locally in the selected workspace and active permission mode.

Read the [security model](docs/en/reference/security-model.md) before using wuu with untrusted repositories or sensitive data.
