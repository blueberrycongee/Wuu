# wuu documentation

The documentation in this directory is organized as publishable content, not as
a loose collection of repository notes.

- [简体中文入口](zh-cn/index.md)
- [English entry](en/index.md)
- [Site manifest](site.json)

## Content structure

```

The current tree keeps all maintained legacy documents, but groups them by
reader intent. A page may link to another language when no translation exists;
the link label should make that fallback clear.

## Authoring rules

- Write standard Markdown so the same source works on GitHub and in a future
  wuu publishing flow.
- Use relative links between pages and keep images in a nearby `assets/`
  directory.
- Describe behavior that exists today. Keep proposals and temporary task notes
  out of the published navigation.
- Tracked documentation carries only public references. Research notes about
  third-party projects stay in `plans/`, which is ignored and never committed.
- Treat current code, tests, CLI help, and a verified product path as the source
  of truth. Existing documentation is a lead, not proof that a feature still
  behaves the same way.
- Keep feature-flagged, development-only, and experimental surfaces out of the
  stable user path unless the page labels their availability explicitly.
- Add a page to `site.json` when it should appear in the published site.
- Prefer one task-oriented page over a large feature inventory.

The manifest is intentionally small and renderer-neutral. It defines the
content contract without making the Markdown source depend on a renderer.

## Preview and publishing

The site renderer lives in `docs-site/` and uses Astro Starlight. It prepares
only the pages listed in `site.json`, so plans and internal notes are never
published accidentally.

```bash
npm install --prefix docs-site
make docs-dev
make build-docs
```

Pushes to `main` that change `docs/` or `docs-site/` are built and deployed by
GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages. Pull requests run the same build without
deploying.
