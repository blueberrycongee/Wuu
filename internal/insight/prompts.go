const facetExtractionPrompt = `Analyze this coding assistant session and extract structured facets.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:

1. **goal_categories**: Count ONLY what the USER explicitly asked for.
   - DO NOT count the assistant's autonomous exploration
   - ONLY count explicit user requests: "can you...", "please...", "I need...", "let's..."
   - Use categories: write_code, debug_investigate, refactor, explain, review, test, deploy, config, docs, warmup_minimal

2. **outcome**: Based on whether the user's goals were achieved.
   - fully_achieved, mostly_achieved, partially_achieved, not_achieved, unclear

3. **satisfaction**: Based on explicit user signals.
   - high: "great!", "perfect!", "awesome!"
   - medium: "thanks", "looks good", "ok"
   - low: "that's not right", "try again", frustrated signals
   - unknown: no clear signals

4. **helpfulness**: How helpful was the assistant overall?
   - unhelpful, slightly_helpful, moderately_helpful, very_helpful, essential

5. **session_type**: single_task, multi_task, iterative_refinement, exploration, quick_question

6. **friction**: Be specific about what went wrong.
   - misunderstood_request, wrong_approach, buggy_code, excessive_changes, slow_response, none

7. **primary_success**: What helped most?
   - none, fast_search, correct_edits, good_explanations, proactive_help, multi_file_changes, good_debugging

const atAGlancePrompt = `You're writing an "At a Glance" summary for a coding assistant usage insights report.

Use this 4-part structure:

1. **What's working** — What is the user's unique style and what impactful things have they done? Keep it high level, 2-3 sentences. Don't be fluffy.

2. **What's hindering you** — Split into (a) assistant's fault (misunderstandings, wrong approaches) and (b) user-side friction (not enough context, environment issues). Be honest but constructive. 2-3 sentences.

3. **Quick wins to try** — Specific features or workflow techniques they should try. Avoid generic advice. 2-3 sentences.

4. **Ambitious workflows** — As models improve, what workflows that seem hard now will become possible? 2-3 sentences.
